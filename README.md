# Urban_Air_Quality_Prediction_and_Mapping_Using_DeppLearning_Model
This repository contains the implementation of Urban Air Quality Prediction and Mapping Using Deep Learning Model, a deep learning-based project designed to predict urban air quality metrics with a special focus on PM2.5 levels. The project leverages transformer architectures, known for their state-of-the-art performance in time-series forecasting and sequence modeling tasks.

##Key Features:
Focus on PM2.5 Prediction: PM2.5 is used as a critical air quality indicator alongside parameters like PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, CO, temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and traffic volume.
Time-Series Forecasting: Employs advanced transformer architectures for accurate time-series predictions.
Dataset and Feature Engineering: Utilizes a generated dataset with comprehensive feature engineering to enhance model performance.
Model Training and Optimization: Includes hyperparameter tuning using Optuna and cross-validation with K-fold techniques.
Performance Evaluation: Assesses model accuracy using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²).
Mapping and Visualization: Provides air quality mapping and visual analytics for better interpretation of results.

##Project Workflow:
Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
Transformer model training with hyperparameter optimization.
Evaluation using cross-validation and error metrics.
Visualization of predictions and urban air quality mapping.

##Applications:
This project helps predict urban air quality trends, identify pollution hotspots, and support urban planning and environmental policies.
